  <p><strong>Workday to Google Calendar</strong> (the “App”) converts a course schedule file (XLSX) into Google Calendar events in your account. The App is a client-side web application; it does not run a custom backend or database and does not sell or share personal information.</p>

  <h2>1) What Google user data the App accesses</h2>
  <p>The App uses Google OAuth and the following Google Calendar scopes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar</code> – needed only to <em>create a new calendar</em> when you choose “Create new calendar.”</li>
    <li><code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events</code> – needed to <em>create events</em> on the calendar you select.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Using these scopes, the App may access the following Google user data strictly to perform the requested actions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Calendar list metadata:</strong> calendar ID, summary (name), primary flag, time zone (via <code>calendarList.list</code>) to let you choose a target calendar.</li>
    <li><strong>Created calendar metadata:</strong> the ID and summary of a calendar you ask the App to create (via <code>calendars.insert</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Event fields the App writes:</strong> title, location, start/end time, and recurrence rule for the class meetings (via <code>events.insert</code>).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>The App does not read the contents of your existing events.</strong> It only lists calendars to display options and writes new events you explicitly request.</p>

  <h2>2) Other data the App uses</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Your XLSX file:</strong> The file you select is processed locally in your browser to parse course times and locations.</li>
    <li><strong>OAuth tokens:</strong> Google’s client libraries obtain an access token in your browser to call the Calendar API on your behalf.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3) How data is used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All parsing of your XLSX and construction of calendar events occurs <strong>in your browser</strong>.</li>
    <li>When you confirm, the App calls Google Calendar APIs from your browser to create a calendar (optional) and insert the class events you requested.</li>
    <li><strong>No server-side storage:</strong> The App does not send your XLSX contents, calendar data, or tokens to any server we control.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4) Data protection & security</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transport security:</strong> The site is served over HTTPS.</li>
    <li><strong>Least-privilege access:</strong> Only the scopes listed above are requested; the App uses them solely to create calendars and insert events.</li>
    <li><strong>No persistent backend storage:</strong> We do not store Google user data or tokens on our servers (we do not operate a custom backend).</li>
    <li><strong>Token handling:</strong> OAuth tokens are managed by Google’s client libraries within the browser runtime and are not transmitted to us.</li>
    <li><strong>No human access:</strong> We do not allow humans to read Google user data obtained through the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Limited Use Compliance:</strong> The App’s use of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5) Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties. Google is the processor of Calendar API requests you authorize.</p>

  <h2>6) Data retention & deletion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We do not retain personal data.</strong> Your XLSX is processed in-browser only. Events are created in your Google account.</li>
    <li>You can delete the created events or the entire created calendar at any time in Google Calendar.</li>
    <li>You can revoke the App’s access at any time at <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7) Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for general use by students and is not directed to children under 13. If you believe we have interacted with information from a child under 13, please contact us and we will assist with revocation instructions.</p>

  <h2>8) Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will post the updated version at this URL and update the “Last updated” date above.</p>
